## Preparing a submission

SOLVER_GUIDANCE_LOCATION

- Use the challenge's verifier revision for `llm-verifier check --root .`.
- Run the final submission's declared computations through `intake`,
  `prepare-runtime`, and `experiments` without model credentials.
  `test-checkers` runs organizer fixtures, not your candidate's checks.
- Ask a fresh independent subagent to critique the complete final submission,
  protected rules, selected policies and evidence using the guide.
- Fix findings and rerun affected checks and review.
- Report results and omitted steps. Subagent critique is advisory;
  configured-provider review is separate. `simulate` does not judge correctness.
